Hello, in order to make the application run, you need to follow the installation provided here: 
https://docs.croct.com/introduction/getting-started

I did not use React so far. Also it is running locally on the port 5500 (same used by live code on VSCode)

I made this personalization unfortunately to work only in Goi√¢nia (since I could not create to experience :(
